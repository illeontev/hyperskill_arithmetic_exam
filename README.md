# hyperskill_arithmetic_exam
This is my first project published on GitHub. And he first project I made while learning Hyperskill Python Core course.
This is a game where you need to calculate numbers.
At first, you should chooose the difficulty level (1 or 2).
Then you get 5 tests and should write the right answer for each of them.
